## 1. System Overview  
The financial transaction landscape is evolving with globalization and advancements in information technology. Traditional anti-money laundering (AML) monitoring techniques, such as rule-based analysis and anomaly detection, face challenges due to increasingly sophisticated money laundering techniques.

Deep learning technology, known for its robust pattern recognition and complex data processing capabilities, is applied in this AML system to build intelligent, automated models. This system leverages deep learning to extract patterns from massive datasets, enabling the identification of previously undetectable anomalies and adapting to new money laundering methods.

## 2. Overall Architecture  
The deep learning-based AML early warning system is designed with the following components:

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Module  
- **Function**: Collects data from financial activities like bank transactions, cross-border transfers, and financial product purchases.  
- **Data Sources**: Banking systems, third-party payment platforms, exchanges, etc.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Data cleaning (removal of invalid/erroneous data).  
  - Format conversion (ensures uniformity).  
  - Feature extraction (extracts key information for model training).  

### 2.2 Deep Learning Model Training Module  
- **Function**: Constructs and trains AML models using deep learning algorithms (e.g., deep neural networks, CNNs, RNNs).  
- **Requirement**: Requires labeled datasets for distinguishing normal and suspicious transactions.  

### 2.3 Real-Time Monitoring and Anomaly Detection Module  
- **Function**: Processes real-time data streams through trained models.  
- **Output**: Identifies suspicious transactions, generates alerts, and triggers further actions like manual review.  

### 2.4 Decision Support and Risk Assessment Module  
- **Function**: Assists financial institutions in taking actions like freezing accounts or reporting to regulators.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates false positive/negative rates for system optimization.  

### 2.5 Compliance and Privacy Protection Module  
- **Function**: Ensures adherence to privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) and safeguards user privacy with data security and anonymization techniques.  

### 2.6 Integration and Interface Module  
- **Function**: Connects the system with internal bank systems and regulatory platforms, ensuring seamless data exchange.
